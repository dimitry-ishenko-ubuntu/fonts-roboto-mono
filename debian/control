Description: Monospaced addition to the Roboto type family
 Like the other members of the Roboto family, the fonts are optimized for
 readability on screens across a wide variety of devices and reading
 environments.
 .
 While the monospaced version is related to its variable width cousin, it
 doesn’t hesitate to change forms to better fit the constraints of a monospaced
 environment. For example, narrow glyphs like ‘I’, ‘l’ and ‘i’ have added
 serifs for more even texture while wider glyphs are adjusted for weight.
 Curved caps like ‘C’ and ‘O’ take on the straighter sides from Roboto
 Condensed. Special consideration is given to glyphs important for reading and
 writing software source code. Letters with similar shapes are easy to tell
 apart. Digit ‘1’, lowercase ‘l’ and capital ‘I’ are easily differentiated as
 are zero and the letter ‘O’. Punctuation important for code has also been
 considered. For example, the curly braces ‘{ }’ have exaggerated points to
 clearly differentiate them from parenthesis ‘( )’ and braces ‘[ ]’. Periods
 and commas are also exaggerated to identify them more quickly.
 .
 The scale and weight of symbols commonly used as operators have also been
 optimized.
